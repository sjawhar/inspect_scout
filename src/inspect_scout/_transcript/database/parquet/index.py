"""Parquet index management for efficient transcript queries.

This module provides standalone functions for managing index files that
enable fast metadata queries without scanning all data files. Index files
are stored in an `_index/` directory with two types:

- Incremental index files: `index_<timestamp>_<uuid>.idx`
  Written during insert operations, one per batch.

- Compacted manifests: `_manifest_<timestamp>_<uuid>.idx`
  Written during compaction, consolidates multiple index files.

The discovery priority ensures concurrent operations work correctly:
1. If any `_manifest_*.idx` exists, use the newest one
2. Also include any `index_*.idx` files newer than that manifest
3. If no manifest exists, use all `index_*.idx` files
